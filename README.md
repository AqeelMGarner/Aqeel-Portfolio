## Description 
My motivation for building this website is to show employers a bit about myself and showcase my skills and talents. The reason why I built this website was to share information about myself, my work and how to contact me. The problem that this website solves is employers will have a visual aid to see my skills and will have information on how to get in contact with me. What I learned was a portfolio website is better than have a CV because the employers can actually see the languages I know and that I understand them. 

## Installation
